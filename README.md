This repository shows how I implemented different forecasting models on datasets.

# Statistical_Forecast: 

I would like to show how to implement forecasting models starting from scratch as follows of:

1. Moving Average
2. Simple Exponential Smoothing
3. Double Exponential Smoothing with damped trend
4. Multiplicative Triple Exponential Smoothing
5. Additive Triple Exponential Smoothing

# ML_Forecast:

I ran many machine learning algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) on time series dataset.

# Walmart_Forecasting: 

I implemented 4 statistical forecasting methods with tuned optimization on Walmart dataset which was published in 2014.

1. Moving Average
2. Simple Exponential Smoothing
3. Double Exponential Smoothing
4. Multiplicative Triple Exponential Smoothing with damped trend
