This repository shows how I implemented different forecasting models on datasets.

# Statistical_Forecast: 

I would like to show how to implement forecasting models starting from scratch.

# ML_Forecast:

I run many machine learning algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) on time series dataset.

# Walmart_Forecasting: 

I implemented 4 statistical forecasting methods with tuned optimization on Walmart dataset which was published in 2014.

1. Moving Average
2. Simple Exponential Smoothing
3. Double Exponential Smoothing
4. Triple Exponential Smoothing
